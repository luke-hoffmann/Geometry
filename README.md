# Geometry

## What is the purpose?
The purpose of this library is to provide a system to work with different mathematical and computer science related constructs, such as meshs, vectors, physics bodies, planes, triangles, etc. 

Originally this library was created in order to implement a back face culling algorithm. The mathematical constructs were needed in order to complete the algorithm. 

Due to this single minded goal, the library was not created for versatility, thus, it lacked many functions and features that more versatile libraries may.

However, since the back face culling algorithm has been completed, the library will now start to be devloped into more versatile systems.
